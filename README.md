## Choosing Aluminum Cuts

Take special care on choosing the correct horseshoes for your frame type. The difference between frame types is ver important as each have their own mounting approach. The difference between solid or hollow core horseshoes on the other hand is down to preference.

**Before you start ordering cuts PLEASE ensure that these fit your legs by going [here to "Tests"](https://github.com/drolsen/r2d2-horseshoes-shims/tree/master/tests) and printing both shoe and shim PDFs (for your frame type) off on a sheet of 8x11 paper and test fit to your legs.**

Please also note that I (as a single builder) do not own all the frame types, but efforts has been made with various other builders and blueprints to ensure that there should be no issues. However if any do come up, please feel free to reach out to me on the [builder group discord](https://discord.gg/Z76xvegwMa), or create a issue ticket here on github.
