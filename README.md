## Choosing Aluminum Cuts

Take special note on choosing the correct horseshoes for your frame type. The difference between frame types is important, as each have their own mounting approach; while the difference between solid or hollow core horseshows is down to cost vs. weight.

Please also note that I as a single builder do not own all the frame types, but efforts were made with various other builders and blueprints to ensure that there should be no issues. However if any do come up, please feel free to reach out to me on the [builder group discord](https://discord.gg/Z76xvegwMa), or create a issue ticket here on github.
